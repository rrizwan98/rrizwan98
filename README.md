# **AI Agents**

Imagine a world where AI agents power everything.
Suppose you want to visit Europe for a vacation. Your travel agent recommends the best places based on the weather to explore. Once you confirm, the agent books the **flights**, arranges **hotel bookings**, and even handles **transportation** (cab, car, or van) for your trip.

It goes further ‚Äî the agent also manages your **meals** (breakfast, lunch, and dinner bookings). From the moment you leave your home until you return, the AI agent is there to assist you at every step of your journey.

2. Additionally, we have expertise in crafting AI-powered APIs. Our approach involves creating custom functions that interface with APIs provided by platforms like OpenAI (Assistant APIs or Chat Completion APIs) or Gemini APIs. This method, known as Function calling APIs, enables seamless integration of AI capabilities into various applications.

3. Furthermore, we specialize in constructing Custom GPT actions. Leveraging tools such as FastAPI, we develop custom APIs that interface with Custom GPT models. These models are capable of autonomously invoking designated APIs to tackle diverse real-world problems.
